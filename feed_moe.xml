    <title>[Perf][Kernels] Vectorize `csrc/activations_kernels.cu`</title>

## Purpose

We have been using `silu_and_mul`, `swigluoai_and_mul`, etc as unvectorized kernels for essentially all of the fused moe methods, so there are free gains to be had there, especially for large batch sizes. This PR expands all of them to 128 bit vectorized loads.

## E2E Perf

Ran on H100 so using `cutlass_moe_fp8`:
```
vllm serve RedHatAI/Qwen3-30B-A3B-FP8-dynamic
vllm bench serve --model RedHatAI/Qwen3-30B-A3B-FP8-dynamic --num-prompts 10 --random-input-len 512 --random-output-len 10
```

&gt; These results were noisy, need to retake

## Traces

    <title>[Refactor] Split up compressed_tensors_moe.py into separate files per method</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29427</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29427</guid>

    <description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;

## Purpose

Similar to other quant methods like gptq_marlin.py or fp8.py, I&#x27;d like to colocate the MoE methods for a given quantization config next to its same Linear method. So this PR splits the monolithic compressed_tensors_moe.py such that each class is now in its own file i.e. CompressedTensorsW4A4Nvfp4MoeMethod is now in compressed_tensors_w4a4_nvfp4.py

    <title>[Feature]: Generalize RoutingMethodType for broader MoE routing control</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/28408</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/28408</guid>

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

PR #27492 introduced `RoutingMethodType` to support different routing methods for FP8 flashinfer TRTLLM MOE (DeepSeekV3, Llama4, Renormalize, etc.).
While this was implemented to support Qwen3 and Qwen3-next models, the review discussion revealed opportunities to use this more broadly across the
codebase to simplify MoE routing configuration.

### Motivation:

Currently, MoE routing behavior is controlled through multiple fragmented parameters (scoring_func, renormalize, use_grouped_topk, custom routing
functions, etc.). This creates several issues:

1. Lack of clarity: The routing method isn&#x27;t explicitly defined in one place
2. Code duplication: Each model must explicitly specify routing parameters
3. Maintenance burden: Adding new routing methods

    <title>[Perf] Improve default fused moe configs by analyzing tuned configs</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/24700</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/24700</guid>
    <pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 22:24:47 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;

## Purpose

With the help of Claude, I took a look at the statistics of the 200+ configs we have for fused moe and came away with some recommendations. Haven&#x27;t validated them e2e yet, but from smoke tests it seems faster.

The main improvement seems to be from just including defaults for `&#x27;num_warps&#x27;: 4, &#x27;num_stages&#x27;: 3`, which were omitted before except for block fp8.
