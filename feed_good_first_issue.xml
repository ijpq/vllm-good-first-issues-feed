    <title>[Feature][Attention][UX]: Incorporate Features into Attention Selection</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/30654</link>

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

SUMMARY:
* we have default attention backends by priority and a notion of which backend supports what hw
* however, certain features are not considered in this (e.g. fp8 kv cache, e.g. attention sinks)

Recent example, we had test failures because we updated the logic to load kv cache quantization from the model config. But since CUTLASS_MLA is the default backend on B200, we started seeing test failures (since CUTLASS MLA does not support fp8 kv cache) because we were not automatically falling back to FLASHINFER_MLA (which does)


So the proposal is to:
- make sure all attention backends report what features are supported
- update the attention selector to consider these features in the selection

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

* we have some chunking logic in the triton kernels to avoid IMA: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/fused_moe.py#L1807

    <title>[Feature]: Default eplb num_redundant_experts to the lowest valid value if unspecified</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/30075</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/30075</guid>
    <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 18:19:03 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

EPLB requires the number of experts to be chosen up front and there is a known minimum valid value that can be derived from the vllm startup configuration.  Since extra EPLB experts trades kv cache memory for potential performance improvements, but that is not guaranteed to pay off, having the EPLB value default to the minimum valid value would reduce friction on enabling EPLB the first time until users are ready to tune.

As a consequence, it would also streamline templating the same config to work across multiple EP sizes for the default case.

    <title>[Bug]: Add validation for tool requests that the tool is available</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/29432</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/29432</guid>
    <pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:04:15 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🐛 Describe the bug

Currently there is no check for this, vLLM will just respond sub-optimally in a &quot;silent&quot; way. We should fail the individual request in this case with appropriate error message.

This is a problem in particular for example when using the demo tool server without the `gpt-oss` package installed.

    <title>[Feature]: Optimize collectives in TP MoE case using torch.compile pass</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/29139</guid>
    <pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 01:36:06 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

To avoid redundant work in MoE models in the TP case, sequence parallelism was added to the Deepseek model definition in #24134 and expanded to other models in #24982. However, to avoid performing surgery on the linear layer, the current approach performs more communication than necessary. With a torch.compile custom pass, we can rewrite the graph to remove the redundant computation.

### More details

Before the SP optimization, the ops in the model were:
```
- o_proj:[num_tokens, ...] -&gt; [num_tokens, ...] (incomplete results)
- all_reduce:[num_tokens, ...] -&gt; [num_tokens, ...]
- router:[num_tokens, ...] -&gt; [num_tokens, ...]
- experts:[num_tokens, ...] -&gt; [num_tokens, ...]
- ...
```

With sequence parallel enabled, this becomes:
```
- o_proj: [num_

    <title>[Feature]: Disable logging `/metrics`</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/29023</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/29023</guid>
    <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:25:48 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

- IGW hits `/metrics` continuously to understand the current load on the system
- This leads to an overload of logs
- We can disable this with `--disable-uvicorn-access-log`, but lose access to all access logs

We should have `--disable-uvicorn-metrics-access-log` to avoid logging * just * metrics. Per Gemini, we can do this with something like:

```python
# Define the routes for which access logs should be disabled
EXCLUDE_PATHS = [&quot;/health&quot;, &quot;/metrics&quot;]

class EndpointFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record: logging.LogRecord) -&gt; bool:
        # Check if the log record contains arguments and if the path matches an excluded path
        if record.args and len(record.args) &gt;= 3:
            path = record.args[2]  # The path is typically

```
Hello vLLM team, I&#x27;m running into a suspicious ZMQ socket bug with my 2P 4D configuration for DeepSeek-V3 (see below). I thought it is caused by reusing same nodes for many vLLM launches, but now it happened also at a clean node. Seems like a DP bug of sorts. Please find logs attached. vllm==0.11.0.
```

```bash

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Currently if a backend doesn&#x27;t support DCP we get the following error message 

```
AssertionError: DCP requires attention impls to return the softmax lse for decode, but the impl FlashInferImpl does not return the softmax lse for decode.
```

It would good to suggest to the user to try an alternative backend using `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND`

    <title>[Feature]: Implement naive prepare/finalize class to replace naive dispatching in fused_moe/layer.py</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/28236</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/28236</guid>
    <pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:38:38 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

The `FusedMoE` layer has a special case dispatch/combine for EP+DP when there is no specific all2all backend specified.  This makes the code in `layer.py` a bit confusing and hard to follow.  One way to simplify this is to implement a proper `FusedMoEPrepareAndFinalize` subclass for naive dispatch/combine.

### How would you like to use vllm

I launch a server with the following command to serving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B model finetued for seqence classification. (this model replaced the lm_head with a 2 classes score_head)

The launch command is :
```
vllm serve --model=//video_classification/qwenvl_7b_video_cls/v5-20251011-121851/2340_vllm_format --served_model_name Qwen2.5-7B-shenhe --task=classify --port=8080 --tensor-parallel-size=2
```

I don&#x27;t know how to request the server with the openAI sdk.
I use the code snnipet showed below which works well with pure text, but it got 400 bad request when I put the video url into the prompt

this works well:

    <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 16:55:37 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

All the configs in https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/vllm/config are decorated with `pydantic.dataclass`. However, many of them include manual validation in `__post_init__`.

This issue is a call for help to improve the configs in the following ways:

- Use [`pydantic.Field`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.Field) to apply simple constraints, such as `gt=0`, directly to the default values of the dataclass fields ([usage docs](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/fields/))
- Use [`pydantic.field_validator`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/functional_validators/#pydantic.functional_validators.field_validator) to apply more complex field validation to individual fields. ([usage docs](https://docs.pyda

    <title>[RFC]: Limit the use of envvars in vLLM</title>
    <link>https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/25700</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/25700</guid>
    <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:13:19 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### Motivation.

vLLM&#x27;s envvars are on the edge of getting out of control. There are many envvars should instead be configs. Like the attention backend, all2all kernel backend, and even there is a flag to control KV cache layout. envvars are evil because:

1. It is equivalent of using global variables everywhere in the code, which is a bad programming practice.
2. envvars have no advanced structure like, hierarchy, typechecks, etc. 

In summary, I think envvars are the kind of thing that is very easy to add so people tend to add envvars as the shortest path to implement their feature, but this can quickly becomes unmanageable and makes the project very hard to use. 

### Proposed Change.

I think we should:

1. Spend some effort on reviewing the current envvars and move many of them to con

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

In #22205, we enhanced worker process title by fetching parallelism information from `vllm.distributed.parallel_state`. Worker process title and logging prefix are critical for debugging purpose. Assigning them earlier may be helpful for triaging issues.
Explore whether this is reasonably achievable and implement it if yes.

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Currently, we haven&#x27;t had scripts to benchmark mm_processor&#x27;s performance under complicated deploy environments (DP, multiple instances etc).

Therefore, we should add some benchmark script to simulate it and identify the potential bottlenecks.

    <pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:05:20 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

There are some issues with the benchmark script for long requests
- A) we send a single test request to the server to make sure its working- 
- B) generating random data from scratch is very slow


For example, running the following takes over 10 minutes to startup:

```bash
vllm bench serve --base-url http://infra-wide-ep-pd-inference-gateway-istio.llm-d-wide-ep-pd.svc.cluster.local --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324 --dataset-name random --random-input-len 2000 --random-output-len 1000 --max-concurrency 10000 --num-prompts 100000 --seed $(date +%s) --ignore-eos
```

Update the script to:
- A) use a tiny request to ensure the server is working (e.g. 200 prompt tokens, 10 decode tokens)
- B) have a more efficient way to generate random data (eithe

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

We will drop support for V0 in the very near future, and if we want to continue supporting this model in vLLM, it needs to be ported to V1.

The main work here is in:
1. Adapting the custom Mamba layer to match how V1 manages the mamba state. The MambaMixer, MambaMixer2, MinimaxLinearAttention and ShortConv can all be used as a reference for how to do this.
2. Porting the differential attention backend to V1.

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

On vLLM, most multimodal model support was directly contributed by the model vendors, but sometimes the implementation can still be improved in terms of inference performance (e.g, by leveraging fused operations or avoid cumemcpy). 

Two examples are 
- https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/22792
- https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/22184

We should more actively hunt for such improvement, in particular for more popular models such as Qwen2.5VL, InternVL, GLM4.5V, etc. It should be also made sure that such improvement does not result in accuracy regression.

Today many vision transformers on vLLM leverage standard `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` to compute attention scores.

While there has been some effort in [vision.py](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/model_executor/models/vision.py) to help developers easily choose which backend to use, it would be great if vLLM can consolidate non-mask MHA implementations with different backends without caching so that developers can easily plug them in.

We should also investigate integrating FA3 for a few vision models we have and make sure there&#x27;s no accuracy  regression.

    <description>### The model to consider.

https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2

### The closest model vllm already supports.

Grok 1 has already been supported (https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/model_executor/models/grok1.py) and it seems Grok 2 is a few modifications ontop of it - still listing its architecture as `Grok1ForCausalLM` in the [config.json](https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2/blob/main/config.json)

You can reference this sglang PR that implements the changes to the Grok1 definition to support the new version https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/9532/

### What&#x27;s your difficulty of supporting the model you want?

I think it should be relatively trivial since it modifies an existing arch. It does seem the checkpoint is in a weird format, so not sure if conversion

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

From the view of API server, GPT-OSS introduces the following features:
* Builtin tool call: tool calls that happens inside chain of thought. It is different from most existing models where tool call only exists in the output to users.
* Harmony: a new text format to represent the chain of thought, tool calls, etc. vLLM needs to implement the parsing between `OpenAI API &lt;-&gt; harmony &lt;-&gt; model input/output tokens`

vLLM has basic support of the above features on response API now. But as shown in https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/recipes/en/latest/OpenAI/GPT-OSS.html#harmony-format-support , the response API with streaming, and chat completion is still in an early stage.

    <description>### Motivation.

vLLM&#x27;s CI/CD has grown in a less than ideal way as it has built up over the years.

We have the following problems:
- CI takes very long, especially on a per commit cycle
- CI has failures that cannot be reproduced on every machine due to numerics
- CI has failures on models that are not the 80-20 of our usage --- which runs per commit
- CI failures in early tests often lead to vLLM not cleaning up properly --- which creates failures across many tests that makes it hard to identify what is wrong
- CI is NOT covering the models that actually matter (since not enough GPU memory) or hardware that actually matters to the majority of our users
- CI is NOT covering performance!

These issues are creating a bad developer experience for vLLM and causes issues like the CI &quot;death sp

    <description>Verify that we have tests that explicitly exercise parallel sampling (`n&gt;1` request sampling parameter) for all of the following combinations:
- Via `AsyncLLM.generate`, via `LLMEngine add_request() / step()`
- For `output_kind` equal to each of `CUMULATIVE`, `DELTA`, `FINAL_ONLY`

Ideally a test for each of `AsyncLLM` and `LLMEngine` in the appropriate files, with `output_kind` parameterized.

Additionally we can still test `LLM.generate()` but this enforces `FINAL_ONLY`. There is already a test for this one [here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/004203e95330ac9a878df8192619570b0770667e/tests/v1/engine/test_llm_engine.py#L120), but I&#x27;m not sure about the other cases.

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Currently we only have NVFP4 GEMMs written in CUTLASS for SM100, which means we have no support for SM120. While we still expect tuned CUTLASS kernels to provide the best performance, it would be nice to have a reference Triton implementation available as a fallback if no other kernels are available.

It seems Triton has supported FP4 formats for several months so we should have a new enough version of Triton https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/620237edd282d3fa275e7f931af2018423108c4a/python/test/unit/language/test_matmul.py#L652

    <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:41:36 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

#19830 added `QuantFp8`, which uses the `CustomOp` abstraction to implement fp8 quantization in both CUDA and torch, allowing Inductor to achieve superior performance over the CUDA ops (which are unoptimized and also do not fuse by default). However, the class has to be instantiated during init, and MoE uses are currently in util free functions many levels deep. Those need to be mildly rearchitected to take advantage of the new abstraction.

The use to be rearchitected is here: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/c7a00e6e6716f45db09e39cb21a8f91f741f10b9/vllm/model_executor/layers/fused_moe/utils.py#L37-L40

The free functions should be converted to class instances with separate init and forward steps.

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

🎉 **#18343 introduces dynamic Expert Parallelism Load Balancing (EPLB)** for DeepSeek-V2/V3/R1 models.

As MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models become more common, we’d love help extending EPLB support to other MoE models—such as Qwen3, Llama 4, and more.

This is a great **first good issue** for anyone interested in model internals or systems work. #18343 was built with generality in mind, so extending it to other models or quantization methods should be relatively straightforward.

---

### ✅ How to add support for a new model

Implement the `MixtureOfExperts` protocol. Specifically, you’ll need to:

- Expose relevant MoE configuration flags.
- Provide access to expert weights for EPLB to rearrange.
- Forward EPLB-related arguments into the `FusedMoE`

    <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:10:27 +0000</pubDate>
    <description>### 🚀 Motivation

Currently, we do not have a consistent plan for &quot;light&quot; custom ops (subclasses of `CustomOp` with both torch-native and GPU implementations). As we work on improved performance on NVIDIA Blackwell and AMD, we should be more intentional with CompilationConfig defaults that control custom op dispatching. This is a parent issue that tracks smaller PRs addressing `CustomOp`s.

In vLLM, there are two kinds of custom kernels/ops:
1. &quot;heavy&quot; ops like GEMMs, MoE, and attention, which will mostly use tuned custom kernels for maximum performance.
2. &quot;light&quot; ops like `RMSNorm`, `SiluAndMul`, and `RoPE`, which have both torch-native and custom GPU implementations.

This issue only refers to &quot;light&quot; ops, which are (or should be) all subclasses of `CustomOp`.

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

#9160 first introduced `AutoWeightsLoader` to recursively call `load_weights` on sub-modules. This lets composite models (most notably multi-modal models) use language backbones (`*Model` classes such as `LlamaModel`) without having to repeat their weight loading logic.

Currently, `load_weights` is only implemented in a few language backbones. It would be great to standardize this approach and apply it to all language backbones in vLLM. The steps to do this are pretty straightforward:

1. Move the existing `load_weights` function from `*ForCausalLM` to `*Model`.
2. Create a new `load_weights` function in `*ForCausalLM` that loads the weights using `AutoWeightsLoader`.
3. Move any logic in `*Model.load_weights` that only applies to `*ForCausalLM` ba

to determine whether using cascade attention would improve performance. However, this heuristic was developed prior to the FA3 integration and is therefore optimized only for FA2. The calculation of SM occupancy it uses is no longer accurate for FA3 and needs updating.

Specifically,
1. We need to split the case for FA2 and FA3, since FA2 is still used for certain GPUs.
2. Afaik, FA3 uses different heuristics for GQA packing and split kv than FA2. The heuristics in use_cascade should reflect this difference (although it doesn&#x27;t need to be super accurate).
3. It&#x27;d be nice if we can cite speci

    <description>### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Many of the examples leverage V0 internals.

We should:
- raise `NotImplementedError` if `envs.VLLM_USE_V1` with these
- convert them to use `V1` if we can

    <description>In an effort to make the CMake more readable, stable and easy to use we have a few tasks we&#x27;d like to work on, creating a GitHub issue here to track that progress, some planned changes/investigations:

- [ ]  Have vllm-flash-attn use [ExternalProject](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html) currently vllm-flash-attn uses the parent CMake scope which creates many footguns since it is in a separate repo, using `ExternalProject` will mean that the vllm-flash-attn will be run in a separate CMake scope/process
  - [ ] It might be even better to revert to the FlashMLA approach, where CMake code lives in vllm.
- [ ]  Warn that PTX builds are not currently supported (post https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/8845), currently if there is a `+PTX` in `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LI
